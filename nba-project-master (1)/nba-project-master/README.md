#### Setting Up Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflict with existing Python installations. You can manually setup a virtual environment or run the following commands in your terminal:

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 django_env
source django_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
